# ArabicSlangProfanity
Dedicated to all possible profane words in Arabic , written in Latin-Script  
This would need to be compiled from several sources and otherwise from people's contributions .

Important to note that some words on their own in this list may not be offensive, but are profane within a context.
Take it as needed! Created with the intention of contributing to those who build scripts to ensure civility and respect in different spaces.
